[{"body":"Knowledge gaps Why integrate with the Nmbrs API\nI could not find information about why a partner would make an integration with Nmbrs. What purpose does Nmbrs fulfil for an HRIS? Why is it important to sync employee data?\nThis is the sort of information I'd like to put in the introduction.\nPagination is unclear\nThe pagination documentation and examples do not match up in the Nmbrs API documentation. I am unsure if the pagination parts in my payload examples are correct.\nHow should the integration work\nI do not know what the integration should look like. I would ask the product owner and developers.\nAssumptions Storing data\nThe application that integrates with the Nmbrs API must also store some information from the entities stored in the Nmbrs application. For example, the application must store the employeeId sent from the Nmbrs application in its own employee record.\nImplications of PUT operation\nI assume that developers know that when using PUT operations that they must keep the original payload, and only update or add the fields that have changed in the original payload.\nThis is also assuming that the Nmbrs API follows the conventions of REST API operations.\nApplication operation\nI assume that an existing application integrates with the Nmbrs application. The users keep using the application they are used to, and, in the background, the application syncs the data to the Nmbrs application. I assume that the entities in the Nmbrs application cannot be updated, and the original application serves as the source of truth.\nSolution choices Scenarios\nScenarios and how to implement them shows the relationship between entities and use cases of the API.\nSequence diagrams\nLike scenarios, sequence diagrams show the relationship between entities, and visualise the order of actions.\nI believe diagrams are really helpful, especially for more visual learners.\nReal-life situation This is what I would do in a real-life situation when asked to created this documentation:\nAsk the product owner and developers what an integration should look like for the partner. Verify with the developers that my code snippets are correct. Send docs for peer review and product owner review. If time allows, I would also like to develop a solution where the code snippets are pulled from the code. This allows the snippets to stay in sync with future API development.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Knowledge gaps Why integrate with the Nmbrs API\nI could not find …","ref":"/sample-docs-hugo/deel/part_0/","tags":"","title":"Part 0: Document your thought process"},{"body":"Before you install the S3 File Gateway, make sure that the following prerequisites are met:\nMicrosoft Active Directory service account with the correct permissions.

This allows you to easily replace an Android TV box with a new one, for example, in case it breaks, and upload the appropriate configuration file. The Live TV app requires a configuration file to be present on the Android TV box to make ad requests for the correct network and region the Android TV box is assigned to. Follow these instructions before installing the Live TV app:\nCreate a plain text file on your computer containing the following information:\npid: the Personal IDentifier, which is used to identify the Android TV box to the ad insertion service. The pid must be unique across all the Android TV boxes where you install the Live TV app. We recommend to use a numerical value, for example 0001. channel: the channel that this Android TV is tuned to. The name must match the exact name of the network stream as it is used in the targeting on the ad campaigns. region: the region that this Android TV serves. The name must match the exact name of the region as it is used in the targeting on the ad campaigns. account: the subdomain of your product account. logo_position: the position where the channel logo is shown during ad playback. Possible values are: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right. The default value is top-right. For example:\npid=0001 channel=channel1 region=region1 account=in-rel-demo logo_position=bottom-left Save the file with the name company.properties.\nEnter the following command from the terminal to connect to the Android TV box:\nadb connect \u003cIP address of your Android TV box\u003e For example:\n\u003e adb connect 10.200.0.111 connected to 10.200.0.111:5555 Enter the following command to push the configuration file to the Android TV box in the /sdcard/Download/ location:\nadb push \u003clocal path to company.properties file\u003e /sdcard/Download/ For example:\n\u003e adb push /Users/XXX/Desktop/box2/company.properties /sdcard/Download/ /Users/XXX/Desktop/box2/company.properties: 1 file pushed, 0 skipped. 0.0 MB/s (65 bytes in 1.127s) Enter the following command to disconnect from the Android TV box:\nadb disconnect \u003cIP address of your Android TV box\u003e For example:\n\u003e adb disconnect 10.200.0.111 disconnected 10.200.0.111:5555 Install app Make sure you have the latest version of the Live TV app on your computer. If not, contact your designated company representative and request the latest version. In this stage, you install the Live TV app. Follow these instructions:\nEnter the following command from the terminal to connect to the Android TV box:\nadb connect \u003cIP address of your Android TV box\u003e For example:\n\u003e adb connect 10.200.0.111 connected to 10.200.0.111:5555 Enter the following command to install the Live TV app, and wait until you see the success message:\nadb install -r -g \u003clocal path to the Live TV app\u003e For example:\n\u003e adb install -r -g ~/Desktop/live_0.1.4.apk Success In this command the flags have the following meaning:\n-r: this flag is used to reinstall an existing app while keeping the data from the previous installation. -g: this flag is used to automatically set all permissions that are needed by the app. Wait for 30 seconds after receiving the Success message on the command line before you continue with the procedure.\nEnter the following command to disconnect from the Android TV box:\nadb disconnect \u003cIP address of your Android TV box\u003e For example:\n\u003e adb disconnect 10.200.0.111 disconnected 10.200.0.111:5555 Using the remote, browse to the Live TV app, and long press the select button. The context menu appears:\nFrom the context menu, select Info. The Live TV menu appears:\nIn the Live TV menu, check that the version number of the installed app matches the version you installed on the Android TV box through the adb command.\nYou may be handling many Android TV boxes, so this verification step is important to ensure you are executing the rest of the procedure on the same device.\nOn the remote, press the back button until you are back in the home screen.\nConfigure app In this stage, you configure the Live TV app to tune to the correct network.

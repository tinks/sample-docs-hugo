   1. If the test is unsuccessful, then configure your firewall and router to allow traffic from the AWS service endpoints described here: [Allowing AWS Storage Gateway access through firewalls and routers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/Requirements.html#allow-firewall-gateway-access).

      Perform the test again to verify access after the firewall and router configuration.
